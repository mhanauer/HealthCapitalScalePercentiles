Steps I need to take
Figure out what variables I want
Grab them from each data set
Make sure each variable is in the same order 
Rbind them

Variables: 
FollowUpTimePoint, AvatarClient_ID, all health capital scale items, generate a state ID location indicator



Load data.  Just get the actual data for now don't worry about sub group analyses.  
Add a state ID variable so we can differential them later on
```{r}
